        For decades researchers have been debating numerous theories as to what dark matter could be made up of. Dark matter makes up about
        27% of our universe, yet the only thing we know about dark matter is that it has a gravitational effect on normal matter. 
        
        One such theory is that primordial black holes are what make up dark matter. The basic outline of the theory is that in the first few
        microseconds of the universe everything was hot and dense enough to form an unimaginable number of black holes and now these countless
        tiny black holes are littered across our universe and causing the gravitational effects we have come to call dark matter.
        
        This theory does not go unchallenged however, there are arguments against primordial black holes making up dark matter and, in this paper,
        I intend to take a closer look at the arguments for and against primordial black holes as dark matter and propose my own conclusion as to
        whether I believe that primordial black holes are a valid contender as a dark matter candidate.

        Dark matter is theorised to make up 27% of our universe (CERN - author unknown) and yet no experiment has discovered
        any nongravitational evidence for it. The best evidence we have for the existence of dark matter is the rotation of galaxies.
        According to Newtonian physics the outer edges of a galaxy should spin faster than the centre, but this is not the case. We
        observe entire galaxies rotating at a uniform speed and believe that whatever dark matter is must be the cause
        (Sefiedgar, Haghani, Sepangi 2012). This means that we cannot see dark matter, we cannot interact with it, we can only see its
        effects gravitationally which makes figuring out what it is incredibly difficult. The difficulty of detecting anything related
        to dark matter has allowed physicists to come up with a wide range of theories as to what makes up dark matter. One such theory
        is the idea that primordial black holes could be the source of dark matter and it is this theory that I wish to explore further.

       <pre> 
        Primordial black holes are simply black holes that formed microseconds after the big bang. They are theorised to be incredibly small,
        with some potentially being as little as 0.01 Solar masses (Barsanti et al 2022), and with such little mass there could be an unimaginably
        large number of these black holes formed at the  inception of the universe. Despite their small size most of these black holes would
        still be around to this day due to how slow the effect of Hawking radiation is (Hawking 1976) which means there could be huge quantities
        of miniscule black holes littering our universe and causing the gravitational effects seen with dark matter. The reason primordial 
        black holes are such a promising candidate for dark matter is the fact that, much like dark matter, we can only really detect primordial black 
        holes gravitationally. Currently we have only recently confirmed the existence of supermassive black holes with an image taken by the 
        Event Horizon Telescope in 2019 (see figure 1) so for now primordial black holes remain as purely hypothetical. What this means is we 
        potentially have an abundance of objects that collectively have an immense amount of mass and gravitational force but are simultaneously 
        incredibly difficult to interact with outside of gravitation which almost perfectly mirrors our current understanding of dark matter.

        Another source of evidence in favour of dark matter being made up of primordial black holes is the existence of gravitational microlensing.
        When light interacts with an objects gravitational field it will curve slightly. This effect is usually unnoticeable however when light 
        interacts with an incredibly massive object or objects such as a galaxy or a supermassive black hole the curvature is significantly more 
        extreme and the massive object will essentially act like a giant lens and bend light (Mollerach, Roulet 2002).(See figure 2). Gravitational
        microlensing is essentially the same effect on a smaller scale. Light can be bent very slightly by a cosmic object of stellar mass (Liebes 1964)
        and primordial black holes are objects that are typically around stellar mass. Gravitational microlensing is typically very difficult to 
        measure as the curvature is so small it requires an immense amount of light that can only come from extreme objects such as quasars. It has
        been suggested that perhaps it is possible to measure gravitational microlensing with cosmic objects within our own galaxy via the use of
        dark matter (Paczyñski 1986). The problem we run into with this theory is that it is unclear whether this dark matter would in fact come from
        primordial black holes or whether it would be some other unknown object causing the gravitational field.

         <p class="ex1">
       <pre>
       There are several arguments against dark matter being comprised of primordial black holes and there are numerous other suggestions as to what dark 
       matter could be made up of. One constraint of primordial black holes is the discovery of a 511keV gamma ray of positrons detected in the centre of 
       the galaxy as currently we do not know what the source of these positrons are, but a gamma ray of this energy level couldn’t be produced by a primordial
       black hole acting as dark matter (DeRocco, Graham 2019) which is a significant piece of evidence against primordial black holes as dark matter. The
       detection of gravitational wave by LIGO in 2015 has been considered a source of evidence for primordial black holes by some researchers (Chen Y, Cheng C, Guo H 2019)
       but has also been used as evidence against primordial black holes by others (Wenzer Q et al 2023). Some alternative theories as to what dark matter consists
       of include exotic elementary particles we are yet to discover like axions or WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) (Sivakumar, Manan, Hannah 2024).
       Primordial black holes are just one potential source of dark matter among many others all with equally scarce evidence.

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
         <p class="ex1">
    <pre>
      This paper explored the theory that dark matter could potentially be comprised of primordial black holes. After reading through numerous papers for and 
      against the proposition that dark matter is made of black holes, I believe that there is not enough counter evidence to completely rule out the possibility 
      that primordial black holes are what make up dark matter. However, the case of what makes up dark matter is a special one in the world of science as it’s 
      such a large open-ended question with so little evidence for any one theory. It is for this reason that I have concluded that all the prominent theories as
      to what could make up dark matter are equally valid and should be investigated just as much as the black hole theory. The total lack of evidence means we
      should test as many theories as possible to give the greatest possible chance that we one day make progress in discovering what truly makes up dark matter.
