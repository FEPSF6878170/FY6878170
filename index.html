        For decades researchers have been debating numerous theories as to what dark matter could be made up of. Dark matter makes up about
        27% of our universe, yet the only thing we know about dark matter is that it has a gravitational effect on normal matter. 
        
        One such theory is that primordial black holes are what make up dark matter. The basic outline of the theory is that in the first few
        microseconds of the universe everything was hot and dense enough to form an unimaginable number of black holes and now these countless
        tiny black holes are littered across our universe and causing the gravitational effects we have come to call dark matter.
        
        This theory does not go unchallenged however, there are arguments against primordial black holes making up dark matter and, in this paper,
        I intend to take a closer look at the arguments for and against primordial black holes as dark matter and propose my own conclusion as to
        whether I believe that primordial black holes are a valid contender as a dark matter candidate.

        Dark matter is theorised to make up 27% of our universe (CERN - author unknown) and yet no experiment has discovered
        any nongravitational evidence for it. The best evidence we have for the existence of dark matter is the rotation of galaxies.
        According to Newtonian physics the outer edges of a galaxy should spinfaster than the centre, but this is not the case. We
        observe entire galaxies rotating at a uniform speed and believe that whatever dark matter is must be the cause
        (Sefiedgar, Haghani, Sepangi 2012). This means that we cannot see dark matter, we cannot interact with it, we can only see its
        effects gravitationally which makes figuring out what it could be incredibly difficult. The difficulty of detecting anything related
        to dark matter has allowed physicists to come up with a wide range of theories as to what makes up dark matter. One such theory
        is the idea that perhaps primordial black holes from the first microseconds of the universe could be the source of dark matter and
        it is this theory that I wish to explore further.

       <pre> 
        Primordial black holes are simply black holes that formed microseconds after the big bang. They are theorised to be incredibly small
        with some potentially being as little as 0.01 Solar masses (Barsanti et al 2022) and with such little mass there could be an unimaginably
        large number of these black holes formed at the  inception of the universe. Despite their small size most of these black holes would
        still be around to this day due to how slow the effect of Hawking radiation is (Hawking 1976) which means there could be billions upon 
        trillions of miniscule black holes littering our universe and causing the gravitational effects seen with dark matter. The reason primordial 
        black holes are such a promising candidate for dark matter is the fact that much like dark matter we can only really detect primordial black 
        holes gravitationally. Currently we have only recently confirmed the existence of supermassive black holes definitively with an image
        taken by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2019 (see figure 1) so for now primordial black holes remain as purely hypothetical. What this 
        means is we potentially have an abundance of objects that collectively have an immense amount of mass and gravitational force but are
        simultaneously incredibly difficult to interact with outside of gravitation.

        Another source of evidence in favour of dark matter being made up of primordial black holes is the existence of gravitational microlensing.
        For context I will briefly explain what gravitational lensing is. When light interacts with an objects gravitational field it will curve through
        the gravitational field slightly. This effect is usually unnoticeable however when light interacts with an incredibly massive object or objects
        such as a galaxy or a supermassive black hole the curvature is significantly more extreme, and the massive object will essentially act like a
        giant lens and bend light just as your glasses bend light (Mollerach, Roulet 2002). (See figure 2 for example). Gravitational microlensing is
        essentially the same effect on a smaller scale. Light can be bent very slightly by a cosmic object of stellar mass (Liebes 1964) and primordial
        black holes are objects that are typically around stellar mass. Gravitational microlensing is typically very difficult to measure as the curvature 
        is so small it requires an immense amount of light that can only come from extreme objects such as quasars. It has been suggested that perhaps it
        is possible to measure gravitational microlensing with cosmic objects within our own galaxy via the use of dark matter (Paczy√±ski 1986). The problem
        we run into with this theory is that it is unclear whether this dark matter would in fact come from primordial black holes or whether it would
        be some other unknown object causing the gravitational field.
